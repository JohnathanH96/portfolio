This is a combination of different things I have worked on in school and work. 

This is a system that I created in cybersecurity class that takes 2 characters called a key, and encrypts text based off of an XOR function for the keys. This program also allows the user to decrypt text based off of the same system that can encrypt. The user has the ability to give the key (ex aa or ky), if the user does not have a key, they can choose the bruteforce method that will find the given key and decrypt the message based off of a dictionary.
